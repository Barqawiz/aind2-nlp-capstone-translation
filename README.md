# Introduction
This notebook have different type of machine translation models starting from simple models to advanced models with good accuracy.

The model trained on small data to translate from English language to French, it can be expanded to train on more data or translate other languages.

This end-to-end machine translation pipeline delivered as final project for Udacity AI Nanodegree course.
